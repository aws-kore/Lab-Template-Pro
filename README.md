Our project revolves around the deployment of a basic AWS infrastructure using a CloudFormation template. This template automates the creation of essential AWS resources, including an S3 bucket, an EC2 instance, a VPC, a public subnet, and an internet gateway. By using CloudFormation, we ensure that the entire environment is created consistently and without error. Once deployed via the AWS Management Console and through the stack, we confirm that all resources, such as the VPC, S3 bucket, EC2 instance, and others, are set up as expected, ensuring smooth project implementation and verification.

Key Components: S3 Bucket, EC2 Instance, and VPC

The CloudFormation template defines multiple core components essential for a functional AWS environment. First, an S3 bucket is created to store data like backups, logs, and other files in the cloud. Next, the template provisions an EC2 instance running on Amazon Linux 2, designed to handle web traffic. This EC2 instance is associated with a security group that allows incoming HTTP traffic on port 80, which is essential for serving web content. A VPC is also created to isolate and manage the network for the deployed resources, providing control over routing and network configurations.

Internet Gateway, Route Table, and Public Subnet

To enable communication with the internet, an Internet Gateway is set up and linked to the VPC. This allows the EC2 instance and other resources to access the web. Along with this, a public route table and a public subnet are configured. The route table routes outbound traffic through the Internet Gateway, while the public subnet ensures that instances launched within it can obtain public IP addresses. This setup is critical for ensuring that the EC2 instance can be accessed over the internet, making it ideal for hosting web applications.

Security and Access Control: Security Groups

Security is a central part of any cloud infrastructure, and the CloudFormation template ensures the EC2 instance is adequately protected. A security group is created that permits only HTTP traffic (port 80) from any source (0.0.0.0/0). This level of access control is essential for making the EC2 instance available for web traffic while maintaining a secure environment by limiting access to only necessary ports.

Purpose and Importance of the Template

This CloudFormation template plays a crucial role in automating the deployment of a basic yet robust AWS infrastructure. By using CloudFormation, we can quickly and reliably create a full-stack environment, including networking, compute, storage, and security components. The templateâ€™s automation ensures consistency and reduces the risk of human error during manual configurations. This is particularly valuable for creating environments for web applications, cloud-native services, or testing in a sandbox setup. In the end, the ability to deploy and manage infrastructure using CloudFormation helps streamline our development and operations, making our processes more efficient and scalable.

My role is to ensure the successful deployment of the CloudFormation template. This includes verifying that all resources are properly created and configured according to specifications, ensuring that the environment is stable and secure. By using CloudFormation, you automate and streamline the process, ensuring a reliable, consistent, and scalable AWS infrastructure setup.
